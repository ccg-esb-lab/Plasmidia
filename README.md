# Plasmidia

This is the repository of scripts and data necessary to generate the figures in the main text and supplementary information of the article "_Plasmid stability in fluctuating environments: population genetics of multi-copy plasmids_" by V Miró Pina, JCR Hernandez-Beltran, A Siri-Jégousse, S Palau, R Peña-Miller and A González Casanova.

The following figures can be produced using the Colab Notebook that can be found in Plasmidia/code/Plasmidia_Figures.ipynb:

*Figure 1.* Numerical results for the model without selection for plasmid-encoded genes.  
*Figure 2.* Numerical results illustrating the effect of a constant selective pressure in the stability of non-transmissible multi-copy plasmids.  
*Figure 3.* Model parametrization.  
*Figure 4.* Numerical results of the model in periodic environments.  
*Figure 5.* Optimal PCNs in fluctuating environments.
